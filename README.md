> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: This repository contains the source code and documentation of the practice project which we created in addition to our final exam. The project is not production ready and is still in development.

WorkTime Tracker is a web application that allows you to track your working hours. You can create projects and assign them to your tracked times. 

For the reason that we want that a user can have a track about his/hers tracked times, we implemented a backend where the tracked times are stored and secured using user authentification.
